  summary: Create re-authentication exchange session

    Create a new re-authentication exchange session.

    Request body requirements vary by exchange type:
    - For Visa: Request body with redirect URL is required
    - For Plaid Web: No request body is required
    - For Plaid Mobile: Request body with redirect URL is required

    The redirect URL will be validated against previously configured URLs stored in Dwolla.
    After completing the re-authorization process, the user will be redirected back to your application using this URL.
