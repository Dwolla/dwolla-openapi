  summary: Create a client token
  description: |
    Creates a client token with certain actions for Dwolla Drop-in components. The client token API request requires an `action` as well as a `link` which points to the Customer that identifies the end user performing the action within the drop-in component. The `action` is a string that contains a granular permission for the Customer performing the action within a drop-in component.
